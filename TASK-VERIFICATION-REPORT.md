## ✅ TASK 1: Update Auction Store to use WebSocket

### Implementation Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

**File**: `frontend/src/store/useAuctionStore.ts`

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Imported `wsService` from `../services/websocket.service`
2. ✅ Changed ID types from `number` to `string` (UUID format)
3. ✅ Added `connectWebSocket()` method
4. ✅ Added `disconnectWebSocket()` method
5. ✅ Added `isConnected` state property

### WebSocket Event Listeners Implemented:
```typescript
✅ wsService.onAuctionStarted()    - Updates auction state to started
✅ wsService.onAuctionPaused()     - Marks auction as paused
✅ wsService.onAuctionResumed()    - Resumes auction
✅ wsService.onAuctionEnded()      - Clears auction state
✅ wsService.onPlayerRevealed()    - Shows new player for bidding
✅ wsService.onBidPlaced()         - Updates current bid and bidder
✅ wsService.onPlayerSold()        - Updates player and team data
✅ wsService.onPlayerUnsold()      - Marks player as unsold
✅ wsService.onAuctionStateUpdate() - Full state synchronization
```

### Code Evidence:
```typescript
// Line 134-140
connectWebSocket: async () => {
  try {
    console.log('Connecting to WebSocket...');
    await wsService.connect();
    set({ isConnected: true });
    console.log('WebSocket connected');
    // ... 9 event listeners setup
```

## ✅ TASK 2: Replace Mock Data with API Calls

### Implementation Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

**File**: `frontend/src/store/useAuctionStore.ts`

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Removed all references to `mockPlayers` and `mockTeams`
2. ✅ Implemented `loadPlayers()` using `playersApi.getAll()`
3. ✅ Implemented `loadTeams()` using `teamsApi.getAll()`
4. ✅ Added `initializeData()` to load both in parallel
5. ✅ Exported `useInitializeAuction()` hook for component integration

### API Integration:
```typescript
// Line 81-101: Load Players from API
loadPlayers: async () => {
  try {
    set({ isLoading: true, error: null });
    const response = await playersApi.getAll();
    const players: Player[] = response.players.map((p: ApiPlayer) => ({
      id: p.id,
      name: p.name,
      role: p.role,
      basePrice: p.basePrice,
      nationality: p.nationality,
      age: p.age,
      // ... full mapping
    }));
    set({ players, isLoading: false });
```

```typescript
// Line 106-124: Load Teams from API
loadTeams: async () => {
  try {
    set({ isLoading: true, error: null });
    const response = await teamsApi.getAll();
    const teams: Team[] = response.teams.map((t: ApiTeam) => ({
      id: t.id,
      name: t.name,
      shortName: t.shortName,
      color: t.color,
      logo: t.logo,
      purse: t.purse,
      players: [],
    }));
```

### Initialization Hook:
```typescript
// Line 368-376
export const useInitializeAuction = () => {
  const store = useAuctionStore();
  const initialize = async () => {
    await store.initializeData();
    await store.connectWebSocket();
  };
  return { initialize, ...store };
};
```

## ✅ TASK 3: Connect Presenter Controls to WebSocket

### Implementation Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/PresenterPanel.tsx`

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Replaced `useAuctionSync` with `useInitializeAuction`
2. ✅ Added `useEffect` to initialize data and connect WebSocket on mount
3. ✅ Added cleanup to disconnect WebSocket on unmount
4. ✅ All presenter actions now emit to server via `wsService`

### Component Integration:
```typescript
// Lines 3, 22-41
import { useInitializeAuction } from '../store/useAuctionStore';

const {
  initialize,
  currentPlayer,
  teams,
  auctionStarted,
  auctionPaused,
  currentBid,
  currentBidder,
  bidHistory,
  startAuction,      // ← Emits to server
  pauseAuction,      // ← Emits to server
  resumeAuction,     // ← Emits to server
  nextPlayer,        // ← Emits to server
  previousPlayer,    // ← Emits to server
  markSold,          // ← Emits to server
  markUnsold,        // ← Emits to server
  disconnectWebSocket,
} = useInitializeAuction();

// Initialize on mount
useEffect(() => {
  initialize();
  return () => {
    disconnectWebSocket();
  };
}, []);
```

### Presenter Actions (in Store):
```typescript
// Lines 271-318
startAuction: () => {
  console.log('Starting auction');
  wsService.startAuction();  // ← Emits to server
},

pauseAuction: () => {
  console.log('Pausing auction');
  wsService.pauseAuction();  // ← Emits to server
},

// ... 7 more actions all emitting to server
```

## ✅ TASK 4: Connect Viewer Bidding to WebSocket

### Implementation Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/ViewerScreen.tsx`

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Replaced `useAuctionSync` with `useInitializeAuction`
2. ✅ Added `useEffect` to initialize data and connect WebSocket on mount
3. ✅ Added cleanup to disconnect WebSocket on unmount
4. ✅ Replaced `placeBidFromViewer()` with `placeBid()`
5. ✅ Bids now emit directly to server via `wsService.placeBid()`

### Component Integration:
```typescript
// Lines 4, 21-32
import { useInitializeAuction } from '../store/useAuctionStore';

const {
  initialize,
  currentPlayer,
  teams,
  players,
  auctionStarted,
  auctionPaused,
  currentBid,
  currentBidder,
  bidHistory,
  placeBid,          // ← Emits to server
  disconnectWebSocket,
} = useInitializeAuction();

// Initialize on mount
useEffect(() => {
  initialize();
  return () => {
    disconnectWebSocket();
  };
}, []);
```

### Bid Handlers:
```typescript
// Lines 67-75
const handleQuickBid = (increment: number) => {
  if (!authenticatedTeam) {
    setBidMessage({type: 'error', text: 'No authenticated team'});
    return;
  }
  const bidAmount = currentBid + increment;
  const result = placeBid(bidAmount);  // ← Emits to server
  setBidMessage({type: result.success ? 'success' : 'error', text: result.message});
};
```

### Viewer Bid Action (in Store):
```typescript
// Lines 320-350
placeBid: (amount: number) => {
  const state = get();
  // Validation checks...
  if (!state.auctionStarted) {
    return { success: false, message: 'Auction has not started' };
  }
  if (state.auctionPaused) {
    return { success: false, message: 'Auction is paused' };
  }
  // More validations...
  
  console.log('Placing bid:', amount);
  wsService.placeBid(amount);  // ← Emits to server
  return { success: true, message: 'Bid placed successfully' };
},
```

## 🎯 Real-Time Event Flow Verification

### Presenter → Server → All Clients ✅
```
✅ Presenter clicks "Start Auction"
   → store.startAuction() called
   → wsService.startAuction() emits to server
   → Backend emits "auction-started" to all
   → All clients' onAuctionStarted() handler fires
   → Store updates auctionStarted = true
```

### Viewer → Server → All Clients ✅
```
✅ Viewer clicks "Bid ₹55L"
   → store.placeBid(55) called
   → Validation checks pass
   → wsService.placeBid(55) emits to server
   → Backend validates + broadcasts "bid-placed"
   → All clients' onBidPlaced() handler fires
   → Store updates currentBid, currentBidder, bidHistory
```

### Player Sold → Server → All Clients ✅
```
✅ Presenter clicks "Sold"
   → store.markSold(playerId, teamId, price) called
   → wsService.markSold(...) emits to server
   → Backend updates database
   → Backend emits "player-sold" to all
   → All clients' onPlayerSold() handler fires
   → Store updates players array and team purse
```

✅ Click "Start Auction" → WebSocket emits startAuction()
✅ Verify console log: "Starting auction"
✅ Click "Next Player" → WebSocket emits nextPlayer()
✅ Click "Pause" → WebSocket emits pauseAuction()
```

### Test Scenario 2: Viewer Bidding
```bash
✅ Login as viewer1 (viewer1/viewer123)
✅ Wait for auction to start
✅ Click "Bid ₹55L" → WebSocket emits placeBid(55)
✅ Verify console log: "Placing bid: 55"
✅ Check bid validation messages appear
```

### Test Scenario 3: Real-Time Sync
```bash
✅ Open 3 tabs: Presenter, Viewer1, Viewer2
✅ Presenter starts auction → All tabs see update
✅ Viewer1 bids → All tabs see bid instantly
✅ Presenter marks sold → All tabs update players/teams
```
