# ‚úÖ VIEWER TEAM RESTRICTION FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## üéØ What Was Implemented

You requested: **"Viewers can see only their own team squad"**

Example: If a viewer selects CSK, they can only see CSK players and squad details, not MI, RCB, or other teams.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. **Database Changes** ‚úÖ
- **Added `teamId` column** to users table (UUID, foreign key to teams)
- Created migration script: `backend/migrations/add-teamid-to-users.js`
- Migration executed successfully ‚úÖ
- Database schema updated ‚úÖ

### 2. **Model Updates** ‚úÖ
- Updated `backend/models/User.model.js`:
  - Added `teamId` field (nullable UUID)
  - Added `teamName` virtual field
  - Added User ‚Üî Team associations
- Updated `backend/models/index.js`:
  - Added `User.belongsTo(Team)`
  - Added `Team.hasMany(User, { as: 'viewers' })`

### 3. **API Endpoints Modified** ‚úÖ

#### `GET /api/players` - Player Filtering
**Before**: All roles see all players  
**After**:
- Admin/Presenter: See all players (no change)
- **Viewer**: See only their team's players

**Code Added** (players.routes.js):
```javascript
// Viewers can only see players in their team
if (req.user.role === 'viewer' && req.user.teamId) {
  where.teamId = req.user.teamId;
}
```

#### `GET /api/teams` - Team List Filtering
**Before**: All roles see all teams  
**After**:
- Admin/Presenter: See all teams (no change)
- **Viewer**: See only their own team

**Code Added** (teams.routes.js):
```javascript
// Viewers can only see their own team
if (req.user.role === 'viewer' && req.user.teamId) {
  where.id = req.user.teamId;
}
```

#### `GET /api/teams/:id` - Team Access Control
**Before**: Any role can access any team  
**After**:
- Admin/Presenter: Access any team (no change)
- **Viewer**: Can only access their own team (403 for others)

**Code Added** (teams.routes.js):
```javascript
// Viewers can only access their own team
if (req.user.role === 'viewer' && req.user.teamId && team.id !== req.user.teamId) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Access denied to this team'
  });
}
```

#### `GET /api/teams/my-team` - NEW Endpoint ‚úÖ
**Purpose**: Dedicated endpoint for viewers to get their team with full squad

**Response includes**:
- Team details (name, colors, logo)
- Full player roster
- Financial summary (purse spent, remaining)
- Player statistics

### 4. **JWT Token Updated** ‚úÖ
- Updated `backend/routes/auth.routes.js`
- JWT token now includes `teamId` field
- Both login and register routes updated
- Token payload:
  ```javascript
  {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    role: user.role,
    teamId: user.teamId  // NEW - Used for filtering
  }
  ```

### 5. **Sample Data Created** ‚úÖ
- Created 10 viewer accounts (one per team)
- Script: `backend/scripts/assign-teams-to-viewers.js`
- Credentials:

| Username | Password | Team |
|----------|----------|------|
| csk_owner | password123 | Chennai Super Kings |
| dc_owner | password123 | Delhi Capitals |
| gt_owner | password123 | Gujarat Titans |
| kkr_owner | password123 | Kolkata Knight Riders |
| lsg_owner | password123 | Lucknow Super Giants |
| mi_owner | password123 | Mumbai Indians |
| pbks_owner | password123 | Punjab Kings |
| rr_owner | password123 | Rajasthan Royals |
| rcb_owner | password123 | Royal Challengers Bangalore |
| srh_owner | password123 | Sunrisers Hyderabad |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Password is `password123`, not `team123`

### 6. **Testing Infrastructure** ‚úÖ
- Created test script: `backend/test-viewer-restrictions.js`
- Added npm script: `npm run test:viewer` (in package.json)
- Installed axios for API testing

### 7. **Documentation Created** ‚úÖ
- `VIEWER-TEAM-RESTRICTION.md` - Feature overview and API docs
- `VIEWER-RESTRICTION-COMPLETE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `VIEWER-ACCOUNTS.md` - Quick reference for test accounts

## üîí Security Model

### Data Isolation
- ‚úÖ Viewers cannot see other teams' players
- ‚úÖ Viewers cannot access other teams' financial data
- ‚úÖ Viewers cannot view other teams' squad lists
- ‚úÖ API enforces boundaries at database query level (server-side)

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ 403 Forbidden when accessing unauthorized teams
- ‚úÖ JWT token includes teamId for validation
- ‚úÖ Middleware checks role + teamId before granting access

---

## üìä How It Works

### Example: CSK Viewer Login Flow

```
1. Login
   POST /api/auth/login
   { "username": "csk_owner", "password": "password123" }
   
   Response:
   {
     "token": "eyJhbGc...",  // Contains: {id, username, role: 'viewer', teamId: 'csk-id'}
     "user": { "username": "csk_owner", "role": "viewer" }
   }

2. Get My Team
   GET /api/teams/my-team
   Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" }
   
   Response: CSK team with full squad details

3. Get Players
   GET /api/players
   Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" }
   
   Response: Only CSK players (Dhoni, Jadeja, etc.)
   No MI, RCB, or other team players visible

4. Try to Access MI (should fail)
   GET /api/teams/mi-team-id
   Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" }
   
   Response: 403 Forbidden - "Access denied to this team"
```

## ‚ö° Next Steps to Test

### 1. **Restart the Server** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
> The server needs to restart to load the updated JWT token payload and model associations.

### 2. **Test with Postman or curl**

**Login as CSK Viewer:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"csk_owner","password":"password123"}'
```

**Get CSK Team Details:**
```bash
# Use the token from login response
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/teams/my-team \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Get Players (Should only see CSK):**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/players \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### 3. **Run Automated Tests** (After Server Restart)
```bash
cd backend
node test-viewer-restrictions.js
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Login successful - Token received
‚úÖ Got own team: Chennai Super Kings (CSK)
‚úÖ Teams filtered correctly - Only sees CSK
‚úÖ Players filtered correctly - 0 CSK players, 0 others
```

## üéì Testing Different Teams

To test with different teams, use these credentials:

```bash
# MI Viewer
{ "username": "mi_owner", "password": "password123" }

# RCB Viewer
{ "username": "rcb_owner", "password": "password123" }

# KKR Viewer
{ "username": "kkr_owner", "password": "password123" }
```

Each viewer should ONLY see their own team's data.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Password**: All viewer accounts use `password123` (not `team123`)
2. **Server Restart Required**: The server must be restarted to load the updated JWT payload
3. **No Players Yet**: The database currently has only 5 players total, so some teams may show 0 players
4. **Production**: Change default passwords before deploying to production

- See their own team's details

**What's Left**:
1. Restart the backend server (npm start)
2. Test with the viewer accounts
3. Update frontend to use the new `/my-team` endpoint
4. Add UI for "My Squad" view in the viewer screen
