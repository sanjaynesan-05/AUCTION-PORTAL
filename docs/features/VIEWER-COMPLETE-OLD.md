# ✅ VIEWER TEAM RESTRICTION FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🎯 Feature Overview

**Requirement**: Viewers (team owners) should only see their own team's data, preventing cross-team data access.

**Example**: A CSK viewer can only see CSK players and squad details, not MI or RCB data.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Database Schema Update**
   - ✅ Added `teamId` field to User model (UUID, references teams)
   - ✅ Added `teamName` virtual field for easy access
   - ✅ Created migration script: `backend/migrations/add-teamid-to-users.js`
   - ✅ Migration executed successfully

2. **Model Associations**
   - ✅ Added User → Team relationship (belongsTo)
   - ✅ Added Team → User relationship (hasMany as 'viewers')
   - ✅ Updated `backend/models/index.js`

3. **API Endpoints Updated**
   - ✅ `GET /api/players` - Filters players by viewer's teamId
   - ✅ `GET /api/teams` - Returns only viewer's team
   - ✅ `GET /api/teams/:id` - Checks ownership before returning
   - ✅ `GET /api/teams/my-team` - NEW endpoint for viewer's team details

4. **Sample Data Created**
   - ✅ Created 10 viewer accounts (one per team)
   - ✅ Script: `backend/scripts/assign-teams-to-viewers.js`
   - ✅ All accounts use password: `password123`

5. **Testing**
   - ✅ Created test script: `backend/test-viewer-restrictions.js`
   - ✅ Added npm script: `npm run test:viewer`
   - ✅ Tests login, team access, player filtering, access restrictions

6. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Created comprehensive guide: `VIEWER-TEAM-RESTRICTION.md`
   - ✅ Updated package.json with new scripts
   - ✅ Created this implementation summary
